# Front-only blog made with Vue.js and Firebase - FrenchGuyInNorway

## Why am I making this project ?

I'm a french student studying in an Engineering school in France, in Nantes. But for one year, I will live in Norway during a two-semester long exchange thanks to the Erasmus program. Due to being far away from my family and my friends, I decided to build a blog for two reasons :

- To **improve my skills at web developping** : As an IT student, I love programming and I never had the opportunity to build a full project entirely by myself.
- To **keep trace of what I will be living in Norway** : This will be an entirely new experience for me as I never went to a foreign country alone. I will have to go through many challenges and experience many things during this incomming year and buy writing regularly on this blog I will be able to keep trace of all of this and be able to remember all the things I went through.

## Why did I choose [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

In fact, I don't have deep knowledge in any front-end framework as my studies mainly focuses about IT used in science. Therefore, I followed adviced from a friend telling me that Vue.js was a very popular framework being both super light and fast but also easy to use.  
I had solid bases with html and CSS so it wasn't really hard to understand how Vue.js worked and having already used Angular5 during an internship in an IT company made this even easier. After looking around about how I could make a Blog that was cool and met the requirement that I had, I decided to use Vue.js for the website paired with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Firebase is a very powerfull tool allowing a fully static website such as one created with Vue.js to use a database to store files and information.

As I wanted to learn new things during this project, I decided that I would write all my blogs article in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). This is a very simple language that makes it easy to write my blog articles that will be store in my database and then converted in html directly on my website. As it is a little bit funny for me to use a new language like that, I will try to add a Markdown editor in my Blog so thzt people can try to use this language for their personal use.

## What will I post on this blog ?

### Articles

This blog will be mainly used to share what I leave in Norway, my experience with people, university, food etc. I don't have any goal about how many post I have to make so don't be suprise if the update dates aren't particularely well spaced.

### A little plus

As I love listening to musing and discovering new artists/bands, I will try to upload a new music with my blog articles so that you can read my articles with a little bit of music. I will try to choose musics that had a meaning for me during the days covered in each blog, wether it is because i listened to it often or because I feel that it goes well with my mood. But if I don't have any, I will add one that I particularly love.  
Here is the first one, from the newly released Gorillaz album :
